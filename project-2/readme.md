# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: Building Your First Full-Stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Node/Express/PostgreSQL app,** from the ground up yourself.

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals, a Kanban board like Trello will really help here -- scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (or more, if they make sense)
* **Utilize a data store (i.e. PostgreSQL) to create a database** and interact with your data
* **Run a Node.js / Express.js server** from the command line
* **Respond to at least one HTTP GET and POST** request
* **Use at least 1 HTML React.js template**
* **Make a SELECT or INSERT query** to the PostgreSQL database on at least 1 route

### Extras
* **MVC
* **Include sign up/log in functionality** with hashed passwords & an authorization flow
* **Incorporate a CSS Framework** like Bootstrap for styling
* **Include API endpoints in your application**, i.e. have some /api/ name-spaced routes that return JSON data
* **Incorporate an External API** such as Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape
* **Allow uploaded images** by using a package such as Multer or a service like Cloudinary

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet (most likely Heroku)
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the publically-accessible **user stories you created**

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don't hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems.** Iterative code will help you progress faster
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always; learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application.** It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of your code before writing it is much easier than not planning how it should run

### App Ideas
Certain apps are better suited to the short time frame and environment of WDI:

**Tracking apps**
Keeps track of user submitted data:
- Todo / note taking apps
- Fitness tracking apps
- E-commerce / inventory apps
- Stock market
- Diet tracking

**Games**
Any game with player turns works well within the context of a CRUD app.

Players can take turns for each step of the game and the state is saved in the database.

- Monopoly
- Battleship
- Card games: Magic The Gathering, Pokemon, Hearthstone, Poker, etc.
- Scrabble

**Data display apps**
- Star Wars API
- TV browser

### Feedback & Evaluation
The project is meant to demonstrate that everyone is minimally capable of __applying__ the things we saw during class.

Given __Bloom's Taxonomy__, everyone should be able to apply their knowledge of Node.js, CRUD and PostgreSQL. Students must remember enough of the concepts to to understand how to apply their knowledge / build this project.

##### Plagiarism
Simply put, plagiarism involves both stealing someone else's work or idea and lying about it afterward; an act of cheating. Plagiarized work includes turning in code that you didn’t write or building someone else’s idea without giving credit.

Students are encouraged and expected to use code that was not written by them. If the code in the central part of their app was not written by them they are expected to understand the way it works thoroughly.
